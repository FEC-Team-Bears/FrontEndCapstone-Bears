# User Stories
We worked with a lot of feedback at every stage of this project, here are the user stories we decided to explore:

## Implemented:
- As a user, I want a simple, clean UI.
- As a user, I want to have a familiar way to sign in that is both safe and simple.
- As a user, I want to be able to easily see my upcoming appointments in the app and in my google calendar.
- As a user, I want to be able to learn more about a prospective learner/teacher by clicking on their profile picture/name.
- As a user, I want to be able to reschedule appointments should I need to.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to other users and I want to be able to read the messages other users send me.
- As a user, if an appointment is cancelled, I want my calendar to be updated to reflect this.

- As a learner, I want to filter the list of available teachers by language, rating, and name.
- As a learner, I want to be able to rate the teacher I just met with so other students can see which teachers are highly rated.

- As a teacher, I want to see all pending appointments from my home page and easily be able to approve or deny them.
- As a teacher, I want be able to see the ratings and reviews I have received from students.

## Coming Soon:
